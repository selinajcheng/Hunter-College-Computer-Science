/**
 * @brief A PlayerStream implementation that fetches Player objects from an API in batches.
 *
 * Specifically, this retrieves Player objects localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 5000 using HTTP requests
 * to fetch subequent batches of Players of specified size.
 *
 * Calls fetch *batches* of players--it'd be inefficient to keep calling the API for EVERY single players,
 * when we could possibly hundreds or thousands!
 *
 * Make calls by querying the following endpoint, while running the sample server distributed with your code:
 * http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?seed={POSITIVE NUMBER}&cursor={CURSOR}&batch={BATCH_SIZE}
 *
 * So an example might be :
 * http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?seed=1&cursor=1&batch=5
 *
 * Which might return a JSON whose body is of the form (note the numbers won't matched up with yours):
 * {
 *  cursor: 6,
 *  levels: [ 10, 20, 23, 1, 389 ]
 * }
 *
 * NOTE:
 * 1) You'll have to use the cpr library to call the API
 *    via cpr::Get & cpr::Url
 * 2) And parse the JSON response using the nlohmann::json library.
 *    via json::parse & `.template get<size_t>()`
 *
 * See:
 * 1) https://docs.libcpr.org/introduction.html
 * 2) https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/get/#examples
 *
 * On you to read the docs! It's extra credit after all!
 * We've also included a sample server that will match the
 * format of the server of what you'll be calling.
 *
 * The numbers will be different though, so don't even think of hard-coding it :)
